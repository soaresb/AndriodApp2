# Lol Stats
Android App for League of Legends stats using the Riot API

Currently only get stats for the ranked games of the summoner that is searched for.  It displays the champion played, the K/D/A, gold earned, and crepp score.  Additional game information can also be seen by pressing more data which will show the item build, K/D/A, gold earned, and creep score for every player on both teams.

This project is still under development and is still using a development API key which is reset every 24 hours.  Hopefully soon I will be able to use a production API key for 100% uptime on the application.
